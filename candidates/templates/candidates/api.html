<p>
The data that's submitted to this site is available
programmatically via a RESTful web service called PopIt, which
stores information about people and their positions in
organizations. (You can <a href="http://popit.poplus.org/">find
out more about PopIt here</a>.)
</p>

<p>
The base API URL for the data is:
</p>

<pre class="code-sample"><a href="{{ popit_url }}">{{ popit_url }}</a></pre>

You can read <a href="http://popit.poplus.org/docs/api/">more
generic documentation for the PopIt API</a> or just follow the
simple examples that follow.

<h2>Find a Constituency ID</h2>

<p>In order to look up candidates for a constituency, you have
to find the ID of that constituency. The IDs that we use for
constituencies are the IDs for Westminster constituencies areas
in another web
service, <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org">MapIt</a>.</p>

<h3>... from a postcode</h3>

<p>Suppose you want to find the constituency for the postcode
SW1A&nbsp;1AA, then you would make a GET request to the
following URL:</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA</a>
</pre>

<p>This <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">returns
a JSON object</a>, wherein the constituency ID can be found
at <tt>.shortcuts.WMC</tt>.</p>

<p>There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_postcode">postcode
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.</p>

<h3>... from a latitude / longitude or other coordinate</h3>

<p>You can look up constituencies in MapIt using a variety of
coordinate systems. To give the most common example, you might
have a WGS84 coordinate from a GPS or location API, in which can
you should put the SRID 4326 in your lookup. For example,
latitude
52.205083 and longitude 0.115194 could be looked up with:</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC</a>
</pre>

(Note that the longitude comes before the latitude, which might
not be what you expect.) The only key in that object is the
constituency ID.

<p>There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_point">point
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.</p>

<h3>... by selecting it from its name</h3>

If you need to produce a list of all constituencies (e.g. for a
select box) and allow the user to pick one, you can get a list
of all Westminster constituencies in the UK from this request:

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC</a>
</pre>

<p>The <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">returned
data from that request</a> has the constituency ID as its keys;
the values are objects that include (among other things)
a <tt>name</tt> element that gives you the official name of the
constituency.</p>

<h2>Find Candidates for a Constituency</h2>

<p>
All the candidates we know about for a constituency can be
returned by making a GET request to a URL of this form, where
you should substitute in the constituency ID for
CONSTITUENCY_ID:

<pre class="code-sample">
{{ popit_url }}posts/CONSTITUENCY_ID?embed=membership.person.membership.organization
</pre>

<p>For example, for Dulwich and West Norwood,
<a href="{{ popit_url }}posts/65808?embed=membership.person.membership.organization">these
would be the results</a>. To explain further, that's showing information about the <em>post</em>
"MP for Dulwich and West Norwood". Under the <tt>memberships</tt> key of the
<tt>result</tt> dictionary you can find all memberships of this
post - those that have the <tt>role</tt> "Candidate" were
candidates at one point.</p>

<p>You should then look at the start and end dates of that
membership, which will tell you whether they're a candidate for
the 2015 election or were a past candidate for the 2010
election:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Election</td><td>start_date</td><td>end_date</td></tr>
<tr><td>2015</td><td>2010-05-07</td><td>9999-12-31</td></tr>
<tr><td>2010</td><td>2005-05-06</td><td>2010-05-06</td></tr>
</table>

Under <tt>person_id</tt> attribute of each of those membership
you can find information about that candidate, like their name,
contact details and (in another nested <tt>memberships</tt>
object) their memberships of political parties. The party
memberships use the same date values as above to indicate
whether it's their party membership at the 2010 or 2015 election.
