    <p>Anyone can add a result, which will go into our unverified database.</p>

    <p>A team of people at LGiU and Democracy Club will work through these suggested results to verify them.</p>

    <p>You can get the data (unverified and verified counts) at democracyclub.org.uk/data</p>

    <p>We expect to have final verified data by the beginning of next week.</p>
