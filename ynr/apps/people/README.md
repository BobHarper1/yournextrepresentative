# People

This app is for storing people and related information.

Information in this app should be about a person, not about a person's
relationship to an election. For example, their name might change over
time, but the name change isn't a property of an election they are
standing in.

Thing like their political party should be stored on the _candidacy_.
This is currently represented as a `Membership` in the `popolo` app.
