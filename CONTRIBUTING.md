## Waffle

You can see a waffle board representing all the issues that
we're currently working on here:

* [YourNextRepresentative board at waffle.io](https://waffle.io/DemocracyClub/yournextrepresentative)

The names of the columns there may need some explanation:

* **Backlog**: all open issues that haven't been triaged, or
  are on the back burner.
* **Ready**: these are issues we'd like to work on at some
  point soon, approximately ordered so the most important are at
  the top of the column. (This is somewhat like the product
  backlog in other projects.)
* **In Progress**: these are issues we're working on at the moment.
* **Needs Review**: these are tickets for which someone's done the
  work, and someone else is now reviewing it (or it's waiting
  for someone to review it).
* **Done**: this is for work which has been deployed and the
  issue should be closed.
